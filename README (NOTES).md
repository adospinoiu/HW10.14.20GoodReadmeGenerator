This application uses JavaScript to generate a README file.

It prompts the user to enter certain information by asking questions releveant to a README file.

It then stores thes users answers and when all questions have been answered, it generates the README.md file.

The generated file has all the users answers in the correct sections. 

The user selected license is "pulled in" to the main README.md file from various other .txt files. (Each individual license has it's own .txt file).
